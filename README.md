I have created a to do list app created with Ionic

-----------------Purpose-------------------
I desiged this app to make schedules create multiple lists and create tasks

----------------Views----------------
there are two app tabs that are home and search. In the home tab the user can add and delete lists and tasks.
The serch task is where the user serchs tasks you have saved


--------------Task View----------
in this view the user can create a new task for the selected list. 
They must enter the task name. The label field is optional and is only used to search for tasks.

in  the search tab you and enter the task amd it will search for it and find it if it is there, if not it will return notting
and he search is case insensitive.
